## **Notes:**
- The `JHET_Innovations-Assignment3-SRS.doxc` file on the GitHub has useful notes to keep in mind as you develop your section. If you need clarification on anything just let me know
- As you work it'll be easiest if you create a local repo on your machine and push any updates directly to the main Studious repo - BE SURE TO ADD COMMIT MESSAGES FOR WHAT YOU CHANGED
- Please format your documents as previous ones have been so I can just copy and paste
	- Main Body Sections - Arial 10pt font
	- Subheadings (e.g. 2.1 Product Perspective) - Times 14pt bold
	- Subheadings within sections - Arial 11pt bold
		- This refers to the titles for any bulleted lists/any other section within the main body you want to specifically identify
- Try your best to read through and make any edits to *other* team members sections, if you do be sure to put it in the revision history so that it will be noted on the contribution summary
